I"<p>The admissions department at Macalester wanted a large interactive display for their lounge area to engage prospective students and families while not in interviews or on tours. We developed a collection of single-page web applications that make use of data from the collegeâ€™s CMS and display it in an eye-catching, touch-optimized interface.</p>

<p>The interface makes use of animated CSS transitions, swipe and drag touch events, and interactive maps powered by OpenStreetMap.</p>

<p>One technical challenge on this project was how to monitor usage and engagement. I developed a custom Google Analytics integration that responds to custom events on screen and accurately reports the number of sessions per day, the session duration, and interactions per session.</p>
