*Mac Social* is a social media aggregator for content relating to Macalester College and its community.

The project involved designing and developing a back-end service that uses the Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram APIs and queries for posts according to rules set by the moderators.

We also developed two client-side applications for the service: the public facing site to display the aggregated posts, and an administration interface for configuring feeds and moderating the included posts.

The front-end applications were written in JavaScript using jQuery and AngularJS. The back-end application was written in ColdFusion and interacts with the clients purely through a REST API.
