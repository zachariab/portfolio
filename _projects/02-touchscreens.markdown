The admissions department at Macalester wanted a large interactive display for their lounge area to engage prospective students and families while not in interviews or on tours. We developed a collection of single-page web applications that make use of data from the college's CMS and display it in an eye-catching, touch-optimized interface.

The interface makes use of animated CSS transitions, swipe and drag touch events, and interactive maps powered by OpenStreetMap.

One technical challenge on this project was how to monitor usage and engagement. I developed a custom Google Analytics integration that responds to custom events on screen and accurately reports the number of sessions per day, the session duration, and interactions per session.
